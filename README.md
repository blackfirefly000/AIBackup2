# CONFIGURATION:
   **Notes: READ ME PLEASE. No support will be given for issues discussed here. Please use your brain!**
   
1. All config options support multiple values unless otherwise marked.

2. MAKE SURE the commas in your arrays are set up correctly. Usually, if you try to start the resource with a malformed config, the console will display an error that explains this, but if it's not working, check this first

3. All arrays MUST be enclosed by { }. Generally, all values are in arrays, see #1.

4. Extras and liveries are currently shared by all vehicles of their type and department. (All LSPD Patrol is the same as all LSPD Patrol but is not the same as LSPD SWAT or LSSD Patrol, etc) I may fix this, may not, idk.

5. The livery index number is related to the number at the end of the sign texture in the vehicle ytd. The livery index starts at 0. Example: car_sign_1 is a livery for "car" with an index of 0
